Here's a general guideline on how to add features to your project:

Understand the Feature:
Clearly understand the requirement for integrating the simple interest calculation feature into your student attendance project. Know how and where this feature should fit within your project's context.

Identify Relevant Code:
If you have the code for calculating simple interest in a simple_interest.sh file, you need to extract the relevant parts of the code that perform the calculation. This could be functions or methods that take input values (principal, rate, time) and return the calculated interest.

Integrate into Project:
Identify the appropriate place in your student attendance project's codebase where the simple interest calculation feature should be integrated. This might involve creating new files or modifying existing ones.

Test the Feature:
Before committing the changes to your GitHub repository, thoroughly test the new feature to ensure it works as expected and doesn't introduce bugs or conflicts with existing functionality.

Commit and Push:
After testing, commit the changes to your local repository and push them to your GitHub repository's branch (e.g., main or master).

Update Documentation:
If necessary, update the project's documentation (e.g., README) to describe the new feature and provide instructions on how to use it.

Consider Pull Requests (Optional):
If you're working in a collaborative environment, consider creating a pull request so that your changes can be reviewed by others before they are merged into the main branch.
